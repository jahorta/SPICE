# SPICE

SPICE is the Skies Package Interchange and Content Encoder, a Windows C++20 toolkit for inspecting, converting, and editing assets from *Skies of Arcadia* and *Skies of Arcadia Legends*.

## Features

- Dedicated libraries for supported Dreamcast and GameCube file formats.
- Platform-neutral editable models where safe rewriting is supported.
- `SpiceGrinder`, a command-line interface for conversion and export workflows.
- `SpiceRack`, a Qt desktop application for MLD and paired SST/SML inspection plus GVR/PVR texture editing.
- PNG, JSON, Blender IR, and selected ALX CSV interchange workflows.

## Building

### Requirements

- Windows with the Windows SDK and MSVC v145 toolchain.
- Qt 6.10.3 for MSVC 2022 x64, registered with Qt VS Tools as `6.10.3_msvc2022_64`.

From the repository root, initialize dependencies and run the solution build from an elevated Developer PowerShell:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\amd64\MSBuild.exe" SPICE.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

## Usage

Use the command-line help for the current command list and command-specific options:

```powershell
.\bin\x64\Debug\SpiceGrinder.exe --help
```

The cross-platform research audit accepts explicit Dreamcast and GameCube corpus roots and writes only manifests and semantic comparison reports:

```powershell
.\bin\x64\Debug\SpiceGrinder.exe audit-dreamcast-parity --dreamcast-us <dir> --gamecube-us <dir> --output <dir>
```

Launch the desktop application with:

```powershell
.\bin\x64\Debug\SpiceRack.exe
```

SpiceRack currently opens MLD, paired SST/SML, GVR, and PVR documents and can create GVR or PVR textures from PNG images. Opening either member of an SST/SML pair requires its same-directory, same-stem companion and presents the pair as one read-only battle-stage document.

## Blender importing

SpiceRack is able to export the contents of MLD files for import into Blender using a Blender IR .json format. To use this, load the blender importer script at `SpiceMLD\blender\spice_blender_ir_importer.py` as an addon in blender (Using `Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons`). You can then use `File -> Import -> Spice Blender IR (.json)` to import Blender IR files. This is still under active development, so it is not yet fully accurate.

## Supported formats

Support varies by format. Some formats have semantic editors and writers, while others currently provide conservative parsing or research exports only.

| Format           | Project       | Current support                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AKLZ             | `Compression` | Compresses and decompresses the wrapper used by many GameCube assets.                                                              |
| `.bin`           | `SpiceBin`    | Provides endian-aware read-only probing for known indexed HRS/UI families; `.bin` is not treated as one universal format.          |
| `.ect`           | `SpiceEct`    | Parses, edits, and writes Dreamcast and GameCube encounter tables through a platform-neutral model.                                |
| `.gvm` / `.gvr`  | `SpiceGvm`    | Parses GVM archives and decodes, creates, or edits GVR textures with PNG interchange.                                              |
| `.mld`           | `SpiceMLD`    | Imports GameCube and Dreamcast containers into a platform-neutral `MldDocument`, validates edits, writes explicit targets, and projects Blender IR. |
| `.mlk`           | `SpiceMlk`    | Provides endian-aware read-only battle-resource inspection, corpus reports, and embedded-MLD Blender IR exports.                   |
| `.mll`           | `SpiceMll`    | Parses big- and little-endian member archives and conservatively rebuilds them in their source endian.                             |
| `.pvm` / `.pvr`  | `SpicePvm`    | Parses, decodes, and encodes Dreamcast texture archives and textures.                                                              |
| `.sct`           | `SpiceSCT`    | Parses scripts and canonically rebuilds known structures; opcode semantics remain incomplete.                                      |
| `.sml` / `.sst`  | `SpiceSstSml` | Provides endian-aware read-only parsing and research exports for paired GameCube and Dreamcast battle-stage files.                 |
| `.std`           | `SpiceStd`    | Parses big- and little-endian battle action and entry tables and rewrites fields in the source endian.                            |
| ALX 5.0.0 `.csv` | `SpiceTrade`  | Provides typed interchange for `enemy.csv`, `enemyencounter.csv`, and `enemyevent.csv` only.                                       |
